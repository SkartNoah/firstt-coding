# first-coding

well, this is the first code I made for real (besides my "Hello world"), and it was an incredible experience. 
I used as base the code that I learned in {reprograma} project front-end workshop (you can find their codes in "reference-reprograma-codes"). 

I learned how to use HTML and CSS, made buttons with hiperlinks and download funcionality also editted font, color, background and issues that the first code had.

maybe the archives and codes are confused or messed up, but, I'm glad that I, and just me, made a site for the first time.
